                <h1 class="key1" >What is IoT Based SmartGrid ?</h1>
                <p class="indent"><span class="indent">IoT</span>based smart grid is an excellent solution to optimize energy consumption and
                    offers consumers the convenience of having a real time method to monitor energy usage
                    in their homes. Traditional electricity grids have no way for monitoring the loads
                    connected to them. IoT Based Smart Grid is a modified energy meter incorporated with
                    a Zigbee transmitter that transmits the data measurements live to a Zigbee receiver
                    at the server end.. The raw data is processed by software and displayed as output in
                    the form of graphs or numbers. This allows easy management of the large amounts of
                    datat by the supplier. The server is also connected to a smartphone application, for
                    use by consumers to monitor the real time energy usage of their homes and online bill
                    payment. There is also an option to register the user’s complaints and also queries. The
                    ability to monitor loads in real time has many advantages over a traditional grid. While
                    charging a transformer, the supplier can determine the lines overloading the transformer
                    and then disconnect the non-priority lines. The availability of real time data permits
                    the use of data analysis techniques to generate highly realistic consumption forecasts
                    and demand side management. Since energy data is recorded by the server, bills are
                    more accurate instead of being an estimate, and reduces the cost of the old system of
                    manual energy meter readings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent"><span class="indent">Traditional</span>power grids are being transformed into Smart Grids (SGs) to address the
                        issues in existing power system due to uni-directional information flow, energy wastage,
                        growing energy demand, reliability and security. SGs offer bi-directional energy flow
                        between service providers and consumers, involving power generation, transmission,
                        distribution and utilization systems. SGs employ various devices for the monitoring,
                        analysis and control of the grid, deployed at power plants, distribution centres and
                        in consumers premises in a very large number. Internet of Things (IoT) helps SG
                        systems to support various network functions throughout the generation, transmission,
                        distribution and consumption of energy by incorporating IoT devices (such as sensors,
                        actuators and smart meters), as well as by providing the connectivity, automation and
                        tracking for such devices. IoT can be utilized for various applications of the smart
                        grid including distributed power plant monitoring, power generation and consumption
                        prediction, power consumption monitoring, smart meter, demand side management
                        and various areas of energy production.

                    <p>There are some challenges of smart grid systems with IoT based,they are: communication, cost, information security, and stability of connections which are explained
                        further below:</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>Cost of implementing smart grid system is high. For examples the development
                                of smart grids in the United States costed about 1 trillion, as well as the UK
                                required an investment of 2.56 billion to take advantage of the smart grid. Also
                                implementing of renewable energy in a smart grid is very expensive

                            <li>Information Security:</li>
                            <br>
                            <p>Cyber attacks that may occur on the smart grid system normally attacks on
                                smart grid control, interference and blocking trafc on smart grid network information, as well as servers that are infected by malware. Several consequences
                                that occur when the smart grid system is attacked by hackers.</p>

            <h1>CONCLUSION
            </h1>
            <p>A Zigbee network that streams energy consumption data in real-time was established. Software that formats this raw data into an easily interpretable form for easy
                management by the supplier was developed. A smartphone application for the consumer to monitor the energy consumption in their home was also developed. The app
                displays real-time consumption data, energy used in previous months, the monthly bill
                and also allows the consumer to pay the bill online. There is room for improvement in
                the project. The Zigbee transmitter is also able to receive instructions This provides
                scope for adding a cut off relay that can be triggered by the supplier when the consumer
                doesnt pay their bill, or when the meter is being illegally tampered. The smartphone
                app may be further developed to work with smart home devices so that the consumer
                can develop a more energy-efficient home environment using the live energy data he
                receives.
