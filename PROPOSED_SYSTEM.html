                        <p>The smart meter fitted at the consumer end consists of an energy meter module,
                            a zigbee transmitter and a DC power supply. The energy meter measures electricity
                            consumed by the consumer and generates pulses across it’s output accordingly. The meter is calibrated to produce 2000 pulses per kWh consumed. These pulses are read by
                            the zigbee transmitter whose memory contains a counter stack. This stack counts one
                            for each 2000 pulses recieved. The value generated by the counter is transmitted over
                            a zigbee network to the reciever, every one second. The sent data contains electricity
                            consumed by the consumer and a static address that has been assigned to the consumer,
                            both in hexadecimal form. A point to note is that the counter used is a volatile
                            counter, meaning it would reset to zero whenever its power supply is cut. However,
                            since transmitted data is stored in a server, this does not pose a problem.</p>
                            <p>
                                A zigbee reciever connected to the server via USB recieves the transmitted data.
                                This reciver supports connections to multiple transmitters (a safe threshold of 200) and
                                sorts the recieved data based on the sender’s address. A python script running on the
                                server converts hexadecimal energy consumption data into decimal and into kWh. A
                                python library from Jupyter notebook is then used to plot a real time graph of the
                                energy consumption data
                                </p>

                        <p>A Java based android application has also been developed which allows consumers
                            to see their electricity consumption data on their smartphones. The app shows real
                            time consumption as well as the total consumption during previous months. The app
                            also enables users to pay their electricity bills through their phones.</p>
